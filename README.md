# Description
This website utilizes HTML, CSS, Javascript, and a little bit of JQuery to come together as a fully responsive web page.

The user starts with a greeting and is given a button to view projects.
Once the button is clicked, the window will scroll down to the projects section.

There is a sticky navigation bar that will display anytime the user is outside of the main header.

# Code Review
The CSS starts to style devices 320px wide then uses media queries to change certain aspects of the page.

At 576px wide, the nav bar displays inline

At 768px the header is given extra padding just to help the flow of the website.
This query is really optional and is really just a small detail I decided I liked.

At 992px the projects are now displayed 1 then 2 using flex and flex-wrap.
This is to make the main project larger than the other two.
